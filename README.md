I'm a graduate student at University of Wisconsin-Madison in the Professional GIS Master's Program.
I received my BS-GIS from Eastern Kentucky University in December 2017.  I am the first
graduate of that program which was implemented August 2017.  I am married with 3 children, 
I have worked in public service for over 20 years in many positions including corrections, firefighter,
and EMS as a Paramedic.  I have a small farm where my wife and I raise meat lambs.
